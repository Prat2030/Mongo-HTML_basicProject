# This is a basic MongoDB project made with simple HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

## 1.First we have made a basic SignUp Page using the HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
## 2.Here we have created 3 different Schemas which store the datas of name , emails and phonenumber of the signup page.
## 3.Then after taking the input from the user we store the data onto our mongo server.

### You can go to the SignUp Page from here: https://prat2030.github.io/Mongo-HTML_basicProject/
